Step 1: Create user "aiman"
To create the user "aiman", open a terminal on your Linux system and type the following command:
    sudo useradd aiman

Step 2: Set a password for the "aiman" user
To set a password for the new user, use the following command:
    sudo passwd aiman

Step 3: Change permissions on the "aiman" home directory
To change the permissions on the "aiman" home directory so that only the user and group can access their files and folders, type the following command:
    sudo chmod 750 /home/aiman

Step 4: Add the setgid bit to the "aiman" home directory
To add the setgid bit to the "aiman" home directory so that any file or folder created within the directory belongs to the "aiman" group, type the following command:
    sudo chmod g+s /home/aiman

Step 5: Switch to the "aiman" user and run the script
Each time you need to run the script, you can switch to the "aiman" user from the command line. To do this, simply type the following command:
    su aiman
This will prompt you for the "aiman" user password. Once entered correctly, you can run the script.

Remember that when you are finished using the "aiman" user, you can switch back to your previous user by typing the following command:
    exit
