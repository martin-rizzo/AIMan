'aiman' automatically creates three directories:

~/Models - This directory is used to store pre-trained AI models. Here, you can save files containing the necessary information for your AI software to perform specific tasks, such as image generation, natural language processing, among others.

~/Output - This directory will contain the images and texts generated by the AI applications that are cloned from GitHub. When these AI applications perform tasks such as text generation, speech synthesis, or image processing, the final results will be saved in this folder.

~/Repos - This directory is used to store the source code of all AI-related projects that are cloned by 'aiman' from GitHub. Here, you can find open-source AI projects that you wish to use and manage through the software.
