# Stable Diffusion WebUI

The Stable Diffusion WebUI is a powerful tool for generating images using the Stable Diffusion model. It provides a user-friendly interface and a variety of features to enhance the image generation process.

## Extensions

One of the key aspects of the WebUI is the ability to install and use extensions. These extensions can add new functionality, improve existing features, or provide additional customization options.

### Preferred Extensions

Here are some of my preferred extensions for the Stable Diffusion WebUI:

- __'sd-webui-lora-block-weight'__:
Allows you to set the LoRA weights block-by-block, providing fine-grained control over the model's behavior.

- __'test_my_prompt'__:
Helps you test your prompts by generating images while removing words one by one, allowing you to identify the key elements that drive the desired output.

- __'OneButtonPrompt'__:
Generates an entire prompt from scratch in a random yet controlled manner, allowing for quick experimentation and exploration of new ideas.

- __'sd-forge-couple'__:
Enables targeted conditioning at different regions of the image, avoiding the issue of mixed features.

- __'sd-perturbed-attention'__ or __'sd-webui-incantations'__:
Implementation of "Self-Rectifying Diffusion Sampling with Perturbed-Attention Guidance"
